Discrete location allocation problem
i, j -> [0, 9]

C_i,j = corr matrix

y_j = 1 if j is a cluster center, 0 otherwise

x_i,j = 1 if i is allocated to j, 0 otherwise

sum(y_j) = 3 or 4 (num clusters)

for every i, sum(x_i,j) = 1

x_i,j < y_j for all i,j

max sum(c_i,j*x_i,j)
max min distance from cluster center
